This project is just mere messing around with a friend who just doesn't type properly. We wanted to make fun of him and since I was playing around with React at the time, decided to use this.

## Acknowledgements

This project uses two open source projects by two other friends,
* Rong - https://github.com/TeaGuns/rong
* React-Project-Template - https://github.com/hugmanrique/React-Project-Template
